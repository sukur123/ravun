# Need Help â€“ Ravun Development

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sukur Babaev ([@sukur123](https://github.com/sukur123)), the creator of Ravun â€“ a programming language that's still in its early stages. I've laid the foundation, including the project structure, initial README, license, and contributing guidelines.

However, I'm currently encountering some technical and architectural challenges that are beyond my current skill level. If you're an experienced developer or simply interested in language design, **your help would be invaluable**.

## What I Need Help With

- Building the core compiler/interpreter logic
- Designing syntax parsing and evaluation
- Memory management and performance optimization
- Writing tests and setting up CI/CD
- Integrating cross-platform build tools

## Why Contribute?

- Be part of an innovative programming language from the ground up
- Help define standards and shape its future
- Gain experience and visibility in open source
- Join a welcoming, learning-oriented community

If you're curious, interested, or just want to lend a hand, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sukur123/ravun/issues), fork the repo, or reach out via discussions!

Thank you in advance ðŸ’œ  
â€” Sukur Babaev
